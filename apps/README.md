# Apps

This directory contains various scripts I've put together to quickly and easily create
images of various large and/or popular programs. I give no guarantee that they will
work correctly or as desired; these have been put together largely for my own usage.

These scripts are all targeted for use on x86_64 Linux systems with GLIBC.
